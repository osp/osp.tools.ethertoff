RELEARN
=======

Web platform, initially for the OSP 2013 Summerschool bearing this name.

<http://relearn.be/>

Relearn.be is structured as a wiki where each page constitutes an Etherpad.

The pad is available to logged in users (‘write-mode’). 
The text of the pad is available to everyone (‘read-mode’).

The integration between Django and Etherpad is based on <https://github.com/sfyn/django-etherpad-lite>
