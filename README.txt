RELEARN (aka. Ethertoff)
========================

Simple collaborative web platform, initially developed for the OSP 2013 Summerschool
bearing this name.

<http://relearn.be/>

Relearn.be is structured as a wiki where each page constitutes an Etherpad.

The pad is available to logged in users (‘write-mode’).
The text of the pad is available to everyone (‘read-mode’).

relearn.be is a shell for an Etherpad installation hosted on the same domain.
This integration is based on Sofian Benaissa’s bridge between Django and Etherpad,
originally created for THINK WE MUST/CON-VOCATION a performance during Promiscuous
Infrastructures entrelacées, an exhibition by the collective Artivistic at SKOL.

## Installation instructions

    # Requires Django 1.5
    # First create and install a virtual environment [1]. Then:
    pip install "django<1.6"
    pip install https://github.com/devjones/PyEtherpadLite/archive/master.zip

    mkdir -p ~/src/
    cd ~/src
    git clone git://git.constantvzw.org/relearn.be.git
    cd relearn.be      # [2]
    cd relearn
    cp local_settings.py.example local_settings.py
    # Add database details to local_settings.py
    cd ..
    python manage.py syncdb

    # --> and then install etherpad

    mkdir -p ~/src
    cd ~/src
    git clone https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite.git

    # --> install node js
    Linux Binaries (.tar.gz) from http://nodejs.org/download/

    # run it with:

    ~/src/etherpad-lite/bin/run.sh

    Your Etherpad is running at http://12.0.0.1:9001/

    in Etherpad’s folder, you will find a file called APIKEY.txt
    you need it’s contents later

    Run the surver:
    python manage.py runserver
    visit the admin at: http://127.0.0.1:800/admin/
    you can login with the superuser
    Etherpadlite > Servers > Add
    url: http://127.0.0.1:9001/
    api_key: the contents of APIKEY.txt
    Auth > Group > Add
    Add your superuser to group you just created
    Etherpadlite > Group > Add
    Create an Etherpad Group based upon the group you just created.

    Now relearn is served at http://127.0.0.1:8000/

    You can set the site name, that appears on the header, in the ‘sites’ app in the admin.

[1] Something like:

    mkdir -p ~/venvs/
    cd ~/venvs/
    virtualenv relearn
    source ~/venvs/relearn/bin/activate

[2] For those running the Virtual Machine from the relearn summer school:

    cd ~/relearn/relearn.be/

Extra challenge!

Installing on a server.

Some extra challenges. Basically we can split it up like:

example.com /        -> django
            /ether/  -> etherpad
            /static/ -> django static files

The django application runs through mod_wsgi (Apache) or gunicorn
(nginx), or whatever way you prefer to run your wsgi python apps.
You map it to the root of your domain.

For django, we need to set up some folder where the static files
are collected. You do this with the command: `python manage.py collectstatic`
This folder we then serve through nginx or apache, and map to the
folder /static/.

Etherpad, finally, runs as its own server. You probably need to use
a supervisor such as supervisord to make sure it keeps running.
You will also need to set up a database, because its default database
is not intended for use on servers. Finally, you will need to reverse
proxy the Etherpad process from your main web server, mapping it to
a folder such as /ether/.
