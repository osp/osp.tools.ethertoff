Ethertoff
=========

![](http://osp.kitchen/api/osp.tools.ethertoff/raw/iceberg/ethertoff-write-read-print.gif)

Ethertoff is a simple collaborative web platform, much resembling a wiki but featuring
realtime editing thanks to Etherpad. Its output is constructed with equal love for print
and web.

Ethertoff has been initially developed for the OSP 2013 Summerschool bearing the name ‘Relearn’.

<http://relearn.be/>

Ethertoff is structured as a wiki where each page constitutes an Etherpad.

The pad is available to logged in users (‘write-mode’).
The text of the pad is available to everyone (‘read-mode’).

Ethertoff is a shell for an Etherpad installation hosted on the same domain.
This integration is based on Sofian Benaissa’s bridge between Django and Etherpad,
originally created for THINK WE MUST/CON-VOCATION a performance during Promiscuous
Infrastructures entrelacées, an exhibition by the collective Artivistic at SKOL.

## Installation instructions

Requires Django 1.5
First create and install a virtual environment [1]. Then:
    sudo aptitude install libxml2-dev libxslt-dev
    pip install "django<1.6" south Markdown html5tidy python-dateutil rdflib pytz six isodate lxml
    pip install https://github.com/devjones/PyEtherpadLite/archive/master.zip
    pip install https://github.com/aleray/markdown-figures/archive/master.zip

    mkdir -p ~/src/
    cd ~/src
    git clone git://git.constantvzw.org/relearn.be.git
    cd relearn.be      # [2]
    cd relearn
    cp local_settings.py.example local_settings.py
    # Change database details in local_settings.py
    cd ..
    python manage.py syncdb
    python manage.py migrate etherpadlite

Change the info of your domain name and website name in the Sites section on
<http://localhost:8000/admin>. **Do not add "http://" in your domain name,
otherwise the Re-index function won't work.**

### If you have the error "Site matching query does not exist"

Open the python shell

    python manage.py shell

And then do the following (replace the "domain" and "name" with your own info):

    from django.contrib.sites.models import Site
    site = Site.objects.create(domain='example.com', name='example.com')
    site.save()
    
--> and then install etherpad
    
    mkdir -p ~/src
    cd ~/src
    git clone https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite.git
    
# --> install node js
Linux Binaries (.tar.gz) from http://nodejs.org/download/

run Etherpad with:
    
    ~/src/etherpad-lite/bin/run.sh
    
Your Etherpad is running at http://127.0.0.1:9001/
    
In Etherpad’s folder, you will find a file called APIKEY.txt
you need its contents later 
    
Run the server:
    python manage.py runserver

visit the admin at: http://127.0.0.1:800/admin/
you can login with the superuser you created when you synced the database
Now, on the Django admin:

    Etherpadlite > Servers > Add
        # if local
        url: http://127.0.0.1:9001/
        # if on a server
        url: http://domainname/ether/
        api_key: the contents of the file APIKEY.txt

Go back to the admin home, and then add a new group:
    Auth > Groups > Add
    
Go back to the admin home, and then add the superuser (and all needed users)
to the group you just created
    Auth > Users

Go back to the admin home, and then create an Etherpad Group based upon the group and the server you just created.
    Etherpadlite > Groups > Add
    
Now relearn is served at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ locally, or on your domain
name on a server.

You can set the site name, that appears on the header, in the ‘sites’ app in the admin.

[1] Something like:

    mkdir -p ~/venvs/
    cd ~/venvs/
    virtualenv relearn
    source ~/venvs/relearn/bin/activate

[2] For those running the Virtual Machine from the relearn summer school:

    cd ~/relearn/relearn.be/

# Extra challenge! Installing on a server.

Some extra challenges. Basically we can split it up like:

example.com /        -> django
            /ether/  -> etherpad
            /static/ -> django static files

To test if everything is working, you can use screen to run gunicorn and
etherpad scripts at the same time, and then use a daemon like Supervisor to run them in the
background.

## MYSQL

pip install "distribute>0.6.24"
sudo aptitude install libmysqlclient-dev python-dev
pip install MySQL-python


## DJANGO
The django application runs through mod_wsgi (Apache) or gunicorn
(nginx), or whatever way you prefer to run your wsgi python apps.
You map it to the root of your domain.

For django, we need to set up some folder where the static files
are collected. You do this with the command: `python manage.py collectstatic`
This folder we then serve through nginx or apache, and map to the
folder /static/.

    sudo aptitude install nginx
    pip install gunicorn
    cd /etc/nginx/sites-available/
    # (edit nginx config file)
    sudo vim relearn/
    cd ../sites-enabled/
    sudo ln -s ../sites-available/relearn
    cd relearn_directory/
    # (edit gunicorn config file)
    vim run.sh 
    chmod +x run.sh
    sudo service nginx start
    # Run the server
    ./run.sh

To run the server in the background, use Supervisor daemon.

## ETHERPAD
Etherpad, finally, runs as its own server. You probably need to use
a supervisor such as supervisord to make sure it keeps running.
You will also need to set up a database, because its default database
is not intended for use on servers. Finally, you will need to reverse
proxy the Etherpad process from your main web server, mapping it to
a folder such as /ether/.

## SUPERVISOR
To run django and etherpad in the background.

    sudo aptitude install supervisor
    # Edit specific config file for each application in /etc/supervisor/conf.d/
    # Example of config file:

    [program:pads]
    directory = /absolute/path/to/etherpad-lite/bin/
    user = username
    command = /absolute/path/to/etherpad-lite/bin/run.sh
    stopwaitsecs=60

    stdout_logfile = /absolute/path/to/etherpad-lite/logfile.log
    stderr_logfile = /absolute/path/to/etherpad-lite/logfile.log

    # Then run the apps daemon
    supervisord
    supervisorctl start app_name
